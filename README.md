# 📚 ETCD Performance Optimization Using B-Tree Implementation

## 📝 Abstract
This research presents a performance-optimized implementation of ETCD—a distributed key-value store used as the primary datastore in Kubernetes—leveraging B-Tree data structures. While the traditional Adelson-Velsky and Landis (AVL) trees offer acceptable efficiency, they exhibit performance bottlenecks as data scales, particularly in CPU utilization. Our proposed B-Tree implementation outperforms AVL in insertion, deletion, and search operations, demonstrating enhanced scalability and efficiency, specifically reducing CPU usage and improving time complexity metrics. Experimental analyses were conducted across varied ETCD data store sizes, ranging from 16GB to 64GB, and performance was benchmarked based on operational timings and resource utilization.
